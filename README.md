# Kia ora, I'm Shreyas üëãüèΩ

## About me

I'm an engineer living in New Zealand with eight years of experience in the finance industry working in various roles right from an intern level up to a senior position, spanning infrastructure/cloud, DevOps, software development, as well as a sprinkling of product management experience. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasrama">LinkedIn</a> if you want more details.

In 2025 I left the industry to start a Masters in Geospatial Data Science, as I'm more interested in solving problems in areas such as transportation, urban planning, and health - by combining my existing engineering with skills with GIS.

## What I'm working on

A whole variety of stuff. Going back to university has given me a lot of time to work on things I find interesting, and programming/tech work feels a lot more interesting when you're not having to do it day in, day out. Aside from my Masters workload, I've been working on the following:

- ‚òÄÔ∏è [Solar energy potential mapping](https://github.com/rewiring-nz/solar-estimates/) with [Rewiring Aotearoa](https://www.rewiring.nz/)
- üöå Projects with GTFS data
  - mostly interacting with Christchurch Metro's APIs
- üíª Web development
  - contract work (e.g. [Heartsync](https://heartsync.co.nz/))
  - personal projects (e.g. [SimpleJournaler](https://simplejournaler.app/), [Mostly Good Ideas](https://mostlygoodideas.nz/))
  - ...and a secret upcoming SaaS

## What I like working with

I'm not beholden to a set of tools and strongly prefer to understand what different languages or frameworks excel at, as well as what appeals to me from a DX/ergonomics perspective. As a result I've tried a lot of different tech through work and in my own time, but a few that have stuck with me:
