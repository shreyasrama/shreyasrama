# Kia ora, I'm Shreyas

## About me

I have eight years of experience in the finance industry working in various engineering roles right from an intern level up to a senior position, spanning infrastructure/cloud, DevOps, software engineering, as well as a sprinkling of product experience. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you want more details.

In 2025 I left the industry to start a Masters in Geospatial Data Science, as I'm more interested in solving problems in areas such as transportation, urban planning, and health from a GIS perspective combined with my technical skills.

## What I'm working on

A whole variety of stuff. Going back to university has given me a lot of time to work on things I find interesting, and programming/tech work feels a lot more interesting when you're not having to do it day in, day out. Aside from my Masters workload, I've been working on the following:

- Projects with GTFS data
- Web development
  - contract work
  - personal projects
  - an upcoming SaaS product
