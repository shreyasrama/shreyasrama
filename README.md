# Kia ora, I'm Shreyas 👋🏽

## About me

I'm an engineer living in New Zealand with eight years of experience in the finance industry. During that time I've worked in various roles right from an intern level up to a senior position, spanning infrastructure/cloud, DevOps, software development, as well as a sprinkling of product management experience.

Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasrama">LinkedIn</a>.

In 2025 I began a Masters in Geospatial Data Science at the University of Canterbury, as I'm more interested in working in areas such as transportation, urban planning, and health.

## What I'm working on

A whole variety of stuff -- going back to university has given me a lot of time to try things that I find interesting. I've been working on the following:

- ☀️ [Solar energy potential mapping](https://github.com/rewiring-nz/solar-estimates/) with [Rewiring Aotearoa](https://www.rewiring.nz/)
- 🚌 Projects with GTFS/SIRI data: 
  - [map-matching with Valhalla](https://github.com/shreyasrama/metro-map-matching)
  - [investigating bus delays](https://github.com/shreyasrama/metro-bus-delays)
  - [real-time delay dashboarding](https://github.com/shreyasrama/metro-bus-delays-live)
- 💻 Web development
  - contract work (e.g. [Heartsync](https://heartsync.co.nz/))
  - personal projects (e.g. [What Am I Listening To?](https://what-am-i-listening-to.rama.nz/), [Mostly Good Ideas](https://mostlygoodideas.nz/))
  - ...and an upcoming SaaS

## What I like working with

I've tried a lot of different languages, frameworks, and stacks through work and in my own time, but a few that have stuck with me:
